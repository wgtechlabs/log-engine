WG's Log Engine is the **ultimate logging solution for Node.js developers** - a lightweight, battle-tested utility specifically engineered for Discord bots, Telegram bots, web servers, APIs, and server-side applications. Born from real-world development challenges and proven in production environments like the [Unthread Discord Bot](https://github.com/wgtechlabs/unthread-discord-bot/), Log Engine delivers enterprise-grade logging with zero complexity.

**Stop wrestling with logging configurations and start building amazing applications.** Whether you're creating the next viral Discord community bot, building high-performance APIs, developing microservices, or deploying production servers, Log Engine provides intelligent terminal-based logging that scales with your application's growth - from your first "Hello World" to handling millions of requests across distributed systems.

## ‚ù£Ô∏è Motivation

Picture this: It's 2 AM, your server is crashing in production, and you're staring at a terminal filled with thousands of debug messages mixed with critical errors. Sound familiar? I've been there too many times. I created Log Engine because every developer deserves to sleep peacefully, knowing their logs are working intelligently in the background.

Log Engine transforms your development experience from chaotic debugging sessions into confident, data-driven problem solving. No more guessing what went wrong, no more drowning in irrelevant logs, no more manual configuration headaches. Just clear, contextual information exactly when and where you need it. Because great applications deserve great logging, and great developers deserve tools that just work.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal overhead with maximum performance - designed to enhance your application, not slow it down.
- **No Learning Curve**: Dead simple API that you can master in seconds. No extensive documentation, complex configurations, or setup required - Log Engine works instantly.
- **Multiple Log Levels**: Support for DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and SILENT levels with smart filtering - just set your level and let it handle the rest.
- **Auto-Configuration**: Intelligent environment-based setup using NODE_ENV variables. No config files, initialization scripts, or manual setup - Log Engine works perfectly out of the box.
- **Timestamp Support**: Formatted timestamps with both ISO and human-readable formats - all the formatting you need built right in.
- **TypeScript Ready**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions for a seamless development experience.
- **Zero Dependencies**: No external dependencies for maximum compatibility and security - keeps your bundle clean and your project simple.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API that works seamlessly with existing Node.js applications. Just `import` and start logging - no middleware, plugins, or configuration required.

## ü§î How It Works

1. Log Engine automatically detects your environment using `NODE_ENV` and sets appropriate log levels for optimal performance
2. When you call logging methods, messages are filtered based on the configured severity level (only messages at or above the set level are displayed)
3. Each log message is instantly formatted with precise timestamps in both ISO and human-readable formats
4. Messages are output to the console with clear level indicators, making debugging and monitoring effortless

## üì¶ Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install @wgtechlabs/log-engine
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @wgtechlabs/log-engine
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Quick Start

```typescript
import { LogEngine, LogLevel } from '@wgtechlabs/log-engine';

// Basic usage with auto-configuration based on NODE_ENV
LogEngine.debug('This is a debug message');
LogEngine.info('This is an info message');
LogEngine.warn('This is a warning message');
LogEngine.error('This is an error message');
```

### Custom Configuration

```typescript
import { LogEngine, LogLevel } from '@wgtechlabs/log-engine';

// Configure based on your custom environment variable
const env = process.env.APP_ENV || 'development';

if (env === 'production') {
    LogEngine.configure({ level: LogLevel.ERROR });
} else if (env === 'staging') {
    LogEngine.configure({ level: LogLevel.WARN });
} else {
    LogEngine.configure({ level: LogLevel.DEBUG });
}

// Now use Log Engine - only messages at or above the configured level will be shown
LogEngine.debug('This will only show in development');
LogEngine.info('General information');
LogEngine.warn('Warning message');
LogEngine.error('Error message');
```

### Log Levels

Log Engine supports the following levels (in order of severity):

- `LogLevel.DEBUG` (0) - Detailed information for debugging
- `LogLevel.INFO` (1) - General information
- `LogLevel.WARN` (2) - Warning messages
- `LogLevel.ERROR` (3) - Error messages
- `LogLevel.SILENT` (4) - No output

### Auto-Configuration

Log Engine automatically configures itself based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

- `production` ‚Üí `LogLevel.WARN`
- `development` ‚Üí `LogLevel.DEBUG`
- `test` ‚Üí `LogLevel.ERROR`
- `default` ‚Üí `LogLevel.INFO`

### Log Format

Log messages are formatted with timestamps and levels:

```
[2025-05-20T16:57:45.678Z] [4:57 PM] [INFO] Message here.
```
