## 💖 How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this open source project. Any contributions are welcome and appreciated. Be sure to read the details of each section for you to start contributing.

### 🧬 Development

If you can write code then create a pull request to this repo and I will review your code.

#### Branch Strategy

**Local Development Workflow:**

- **Work directly on any feature branch** for development and bug fixes
- **No CI/CD pipeline** - all validation happens locally
- **Use local testing commands** for quick validation before commits

**Production Workflow:**  

- **Create PR to `main`** for production releases
- **Local validation required** before creating PR
- **All quality checks must pass locally** before requesting review

> **Important**: Please ensure all tests and linting pass locally before submitting pull requests. This project is configured for local-only development workflows.

#### 🔧 Setup

To get started with development:

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/log-engine.git
   cd log-engine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Build the project**

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

4. **Run tests to verify setup**

   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

> **Note**: This project uses Yarn for dependency management. Please use `yarn` for all development tasks to ensure consistency with our package manager configuration.

Please refer to the [README](./README.md) for more detailed setup instructions.

### 🧪 Testing

This section provides comprehensive information about testing the log-engine project and our two-tier testing strategy optimized for different development workflows.

#### Local Development Testing Strategy

We use a **simplified local testing** approach optimized for developer productivity:

🚀 **Local Development Testing**

- **Fast feedback** in ~3-5 seconds with `yarn test`
- **Quick validation** without coverage generation using `yarn test --silent`
- **Optimized for iteration** speed and developer productivity

🛡️ **Comprehensive Local Testing**

- **Full coverage** reporting with `yarn test:coverage`
- **Security validation** with `yarn secure` (requires Snyk account)
- **Complete validation** with `yarn validate` before creating PRs

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# 🚀 Fast local testing (recommended for development)
yarn test

# 🛡️ Full testing with coverage (before creating PRs)
yarn test:coverage

# 📊 Coverage only
yarn test:coverage

# 👀 Watch mode for development
yarn test:watch

# 🐛 Debug test issues
yarn test:debug
```

#### Test Commands Reference

| Command | Speed | Coverage | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| `test` | ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ | ❌ | Quick validation, daily development |
| `test:coverage` | ⚡⚡⚡ | ✅ | Pre-PR testing, quality assurance |
| `test:debug` | ⚡⚡ | ❌ | Troubleshooting hanging tests |
| `test:watch` | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ | ❌ | Live development, TDD workflow |

#### Development Workflow

**For Feature Development:**

1. Work on feature branch from `main`
2. Use `yarn test` for quick validation during development
3. Use `yarn lint` to check code quality
4. Commit changes with descriptive messages
5. Iterate quickly with fast local feedback

**For Production Release:**

1. Run full validation: `yarn validate` (lint + test + build)
2. Ensure coverage requirements are met with `yarn test:coverage`
3. Run security checks: `yarn secure` (if Snyk is configured)
4. Create PR to `main` for review

#### Test Architecture

- **Location**: Tests are in `src/__tests__/` organized by component
- **Utilities**: Async test utilities in `async-test-utils.ts` for reliable file/HTTP testing
- **Isolation**: Each test uses unique directories to prevent conflicts
- **Cleanup**: Automated cleanup with timeout protection
- **CI Optimization**: Different configs for local vs CI environments

#### Test Output Suppression

The project uses a clean testing approach that suppresses noisy console output:

- **Global Setup**: `jest.setup.js` automatically mocks `console.error` during tests to prevent confusing output
- **Production Code**: Error logging works normally in production - suppression only applies to test environments
- **Test Isolation**: Each test maintains proper error logging behavior while keeping console output clean
- **CI/CD**: Clean test output in continuous integration environments without affecting production logging

This approach ensures that test logs remain readable while preserving all error logging functionality in production code.

#### Contributing Tests

**Local Development:**

1. Write your tests alongside feature development
2. Run `yarn test` for quick validation (~3-5 seconds)
3. Ensure tests follow established patterns and are isolated
4. Use `yarn test:watch` for live development feedback

**Pre-Pull Request:**

1. Run full test suite: `yarn test:coverage`
2. Verify coverage requirements are met (should be 80%+)
3. Test across different scenarios and edge cases
4. Run linting: `yarn lint`
5. Run full validation: `yarn validate`

**Pull Request Checklist:**

- [ ] All tests pass with `yarn test`
- [ ] Coverage requirements met with `yarn test:coverage`  
- [ ] New functionality has corresponding tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are covered
- [ ] Test names are descriptive and follow conventions
- [ ] No test pollution (tests are properly isolated)
- [ ] Tests complete quickly (no arbitrary timeouts)
- [ ] Code quality checks pass with `yarn lint`

#### Test Best Practices

**✅ Do:**

- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations
- Utilize `waitForFile()`, `waitForFileContent()` from `async-test-utils.ts`
- Create unique test directories to prevent conflicts
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios

**❌ Don't:**

- Use arbitrary `setTimeout()` calls
- Use `done` callbacks (prefer async/await)
- Create tests that depend on other tests
- Use fixed file paths that might conflict
- Write tests that take longer than necessary

#### Troubleshooting Tests

**If tests are hanging:**

```bash
yarn test:ci:debug  # Shows open handles and verbose output
```

**If tests are flaky:**

- Check for shared resources (files, directories)
- Ensure proper cleanup in `afterEach`/`afterAll`
- Use unique identifiers for test artifacts

Thank you for contributing to the log-engine test suite! 🧪

### 📖 Documentation

## Local Development Philosophy

This project is intentionally configured for **local-only development workflows** to keep the setup simple and accessible:

### 🎯 Benefits of Local-Only Development

- **🚀 Faster iteration**: No waiting for CI/CD pipelines
- **🛠️ Simpler setup**: No complex CI configurations to maintain
- **💰 Cost-effective**: No CI/CD resource costs
- **🔧 Developer control**: Full control over testing and validation
- **📦 Lightweight**: Focus on code quality, not infrastructure

### 🏗️ Quality Assurance

Quality is maintained through:

- **Comprehensive local testing** with 95%+ coverage
- **Security scanning** via Snyk integration
- **TypeScript strict mode** for type safety
- **ESLint with security rules** for code quality
- **Pre-commit validation** via `yarn validate`
- **Manual review process** for all contributions
